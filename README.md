#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. Importance in technology industry is to enable the creation of software systems that power various aspects of modern life like communication, healthcare, commerce among others.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages such as FORTRAN, COBOL and later C which abstracted away the complexities of machine code making it easier for engineers to write, read and maintain code.
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s which involved recognizing the challenges of software development, creating structured methodologies and adapting to new practices.
3. Advent of structured programming in the 1970s which introduced principles and techniques designed to improve the quality, maintainability and reliability of code.
4. Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s that represented a radical shift from traditional, rigid development processes and emphasized on iterative development, collaboration, flexibility and customer feedback.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design- Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation- Writing code and building the softwarre according to design specification.
4. Testing- Conducting tests to ensure that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment- Releasing software to customers.
6. Maintenance- Includes fixing bugs, making updates and improving performance.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear and sequential process where each phase must be completed before the next phase begins, changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is complete as the process moves in one direction while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that promotes flexibility, collaboration and continous improvement, and it allows for chamges and adaptations throughout the development process based on feedback and evolving requirements.
Waterfall would be appropriate in a scenario in projects with strict regulatory requirements such as Healthcare where thorough documentation and adherence to predefined processes are crucial or projects with well defined and stable requirements where changes are minimal or unlikely like a goverment compliance system with fixed specifications, while agile would be appropriate in dynamic and evolving projects where requirements are expected to change frequently or Startups and innovative products like a new mobile app with evolving features based on user feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- They are Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code for example, Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example Git, Subversion and Mercurial.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Incomplete or evolving requirements can lead to scope creep, misaligned features and project delays - to solve this, agile methodologies can be used to adapt to changing requirements.
Tight deadlines can lead to rushed development, increased pressure and potential compromises on quality this can be solved by using project management to prioritize tasks and focus on delivering high-value features first and the use of agile sprints.
Technical debt accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance cost. To solve this, time can be allocated for code refactoring to address and reduce technical debt and prioritizimg areas of technical debt and address them in the development process.
Keeping up qith rapidly evolving technologies and tools can be challenging, thus one is required to invest in continuous learning to stay updated.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- Testing individual components or modules of software in isolation to ensure they work correctly.
Importance: Ensures that individual components work correctly before integration, reducing the likelihood of defects in later stages.
Integration Testing- Tests interactions between different components or subsystems.
Importance: Confirms that combined parts of the system function correctly, which is essential for reliable system behavior.
System Testing- Tests the entire software system as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
Importance: Provides a thorough evaluation of the software's overall functionality and readiness for deployment.
Acceptance Testing- Tests the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance: Ensures that the software aligns with end-user expectations and is acceptable for release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Importance: 
Improved Responses: Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of the AIâ€™s responses. By specifying the desired format, style, or content, users can guide the AI to produce more precise and contextually appropriate answers.
Reduced Misunderstandings: Clear and specific prompts reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings or irrelevant responses from the AI, leading to more effective interactions.




Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Recipe for a cake.
Improvement: Recipefor a black forest cake to feed 20 people.
